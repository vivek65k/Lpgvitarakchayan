          <h2>PUBLIC NOTICE CAUTION AGAINST “FRAUDULENT OFFERS”</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left; color: black">It has come to our notice that some unscrupulous agencies/persons are fraudulently offering false business opportunities for appointment of LPG distributors for Prime Minister Ujwala Yojana or under the erstwhile Rajeev Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitarak Yojana (RGGLV) Scheme of the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies. It has been reported in some cases that the fraudulent websites namely <a href="www.ujjwaladealer.com">www.ujjwaladealer.com</a>,<a href=" www.lpgvitarakchayan.org"> www.lpgvitarakchayan.org</a>, <a href="www.ujjwalalpgvitarak.org">www.ujjwalalpgvitarak.org</a> is referring to their Registered office as <b>3V9C+V53, G Block BKC, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400051</b>. Fraudulent Emails are being sent from an Email Id : info@ujjwaladealer.com. These bogus agencies / Emails may be conducting telephonic interviews, claiming money from prospective candidates and advising to deposit certain amount in their account.<br><br>

The Pradhanmantri Ujwala Yojana (PMUY) scheme does not envisage opening of separate LPG Distributorships exclusively for the scheme. The advertisements purportedly in the name of “Prime Minister’s Ujwala Yojana and/or Rajiv Gandhi LPG Distributorship Plan for rural areas (RGGLV) Scheme and/or PMUDY’ as mentioned in the fake website does not pertain to any Scheme or appointment of any LPG Distributorship of the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies. The website operated by vested people, with MOP&NG PMUY logo and Hon’ble Prime Minister’s photo, Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies’ product logo on the website, is fake, malicious and is intended to defraud gullible people.<br><br>

It may please be noted that appointment of LPG distributors by the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies for distribution of LPG is carried out across the country through a well-established selection procedure comprising of detailed advertisement published in leading Newspapers, hosting on internet site of the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies and conducting draw of lot out of all eligible applicants.<br><br>

None of the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies have appointed any agency/person on their behalf for selection/appointment of LPG distributors across the country, nor they have authorized any agency/person to solicit any money whatsoever from any candidate at any stage of the selection process.<br><br>

The Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies shall not be responsible in any way for amount paid by the individuals to any individual or group of individuals/agencies/Companies purporting to be representing Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies.</p>
